# Level 4 Task 8 -SQL Server in PHP

## NOTE

I have committed the "secret.php" file for the purpose of uploading my projects, but standard practice this should not be uploaded.

## Task 1

Alter the todo.php script to keep and flag completed tasks instead of deleting them.

● Add a column into the to-dos table to keep track of whether a task is complete.

● Change the update logic in PHP to not delete the task, but change this column value of the task appropriately to mark it as complete.

● Change the retrieval logic to show completed tasks by making it appear crossed out in HTML (hint: use < del > tags).

## Task 2

Extend your work in Compulsory Task 1 to hide completed tasks by default and allow the user to see them at will.

● Change the retrieval logic to only get uncompleted tasks.

● Add a button below the tasks labelled “Show completed” that will reload the page and display all tasks (completed and uncompleted).

○ After this, the button should show “Hide completed” with appropriate functionality.

○ For this feature, you’ll need to use a hidden input form with data to indicate what your script should do when POSTed to.
